# Server Source Directory

This directory contains the Minecraft server files and data.

## What goes here:
- Minecraft server JAR files
- World data (world/)
- Server configuration files (server.properties, etc.)
- Mods (mods/)
- Plugins (plugins/)
- Server logs
- Any other server-specific files

## Important Notes:
- **This directory is ignored by Git** (except for this README)
- Server files are typically large and change frequently
- These files should be managed separately from the codebase
- Make sure to backup your world data regularly
